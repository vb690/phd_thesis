When we see a professional athlete competing at an event we often find ourself thinking "how much work they must have done to reach such level of performance". Similarly we might be surprised discovering the effort miners were putting in finding even small ammount of gold nuggets during the \nth{19} century gold rush. Looking at something closer to our everyday experience, we widen our eyes noticing how many hours we sank watching the latest tv-series or playing our favourite videogames. But what do all these activities have in common? They are rather different in nature but nevertheless able to elicit prolonged and vigorous behavioural responses. Indeed, it appears that human beings are capable of remarkable feats when trying to achieve goals that lead to positive and pleasurable outcomes for them. From psychological point of view, we say that in all those instances a common set of cognitive and affective processes, which go under the umbrella of "motivation", are involved in the generation of goal-directed behaviour. This implies that knowing the motivational state of an individual, during a particular activity, puts us in a favourable position for understanding some aspects of their current and past behaviour and predicting its future intensity. Within this general framework lies the aim of this thesis, with the current work we attempted to develop a methodology for deriving an approximate quantification of the motivational drive of individuals in situations where large volumes of observational data are present but no direct contact is possible.

\section*{Thesis Outline}
The work carried out for this thesis, although originated for addressing a series of academic challenges (e.g. inferring the motivational states of individuals from large scale behavioural data) it has been developed completely within an industrial setting. It is therefore the product of two separate although complementary tensions: the academic need to advance knowledge and tackle problems which have not yet found a solution and the constrains imposed by the industry to use this knowledge for developing concrete and actionable tools.

\paragraph*{Academic Outline}
\label{academic_outline}
From an academic point view we found that despite there has been noticeable interest in the estimation of the internal states generated by various psychological processes (e.g. motor control \cite{gallego2017neural}, memory \cite{derdikman2011manifold, nieh2021geometry}, visual \cite{seung2000manifold, ganmor2015thesaurus} and olfactory \cite{stopfer2003intensity} perception), less work has taken into consideration the construct of motivation \cite{mcclure2003computational, zhang2009neural}. In addition, most of efforts in this area of research have focused on data generated in laboratory or simulation settings \cite{eyjolfsdottir2016learning, song2017reward, merel2019deep,calhoun2019unsupervised, seung2000manifold, pang2016dimensionality, luxem2020identifying, pereira2020quantifying, mccullough2021unsupervised, shi2021learning} leaving the estimation of internal states from observational data a somewhat under-explored venue, with a major focus on animal behaviour and a marked preference for completely data-driven approaches \cite{luxem2020identifying,pereira2020quantifying, mccullough2021unsupervised}. In this view our approach has been in the first place to bridge the gap between theoretical and computational accounts of motivation and data driven approaches for its inference. Once we established a reasonable theoretical framework, we proceeded at leveraging it for designing, developing and validating a methodology for approximating the motivational states of individuals solely from large volumes of behavioural data acquired in naturalistic settings. 

\paragraph*{Industrial Outline}
\label{industrial_outline}
One factor limiting the inference of psychological states in ecologically plausible settings has been the challenge to acquire sufficient ammount of data in a relatively unbiased manner. This issue has been partially attenuated by the, now not-so-recent, tendency to acquire behavioural data through telemetries \cite{el2016game, drachen2015behavioral}. A practice, that has seen an incredible explosion in industrial settings to the point of requiring international regulatory interventions \cite{EUdataregulations2018}. In this view, a collaboration between academia and industry seems a promising venue for tackling some of the problems mentioned in paragraph \ref{academic_outline}. That said, industries are often laser-focused on delivering practical and actionable tools serving the ultimate purpose of improving their operations. In this view, given our strong partnership with the videogame industry, our approach has been to highlight the strong connection between motivation and the more actionable construct of engagement. While doing so, we also showed how the methodology developed in this thesis has not just direct and practical implication for automated engagement prediction and quantification, but is also able to overcome some of the limitation of current state of the art approaches.

The thesis will open with an overview on the literature on motivation and engagement highlighting how the latter can be seen as a behavioural derivative of the motivational state of an individual. Next, it will illustrate various approaches for characterizing and quantifying both engagement and motivation highlighting their strengths and weaknesses. The chapter closes with a review of data-driven approaches for inferring the motivational state of individuals and predicting engagement in large scale scenarios. Chapter two attempts to illustrate how theoretical and computational model derived from the filed of behavioural neuroscience can be leveraged for designing approaches aimed to estimate the latent states produced by motivation. It opens introducing the idea that latent states produced by motivational processes can be represented as a manifold on which observable behaviour resides. It continues illustrating a computational model of incentive salience, a particular theoretical account of reward-driven motivation, and how its underlying principles can be used for defining the architecture of an artificial neural network (ANNs). The chapter closes by proposing the idea that the ammount of motivational drive that an individual exhibits can be approximated by the manifold structured inferred by an ANN tasked to solved a supervised learning problem. Chapter three focuses on translating the theoretical insights derived from chapter 2 in an actual implementation. The chapter attempts to achieve the implementation of the optimal model defined in chapter two by iterative model building. Starting from a basic formulation, additional components are added during three separate cycles of model specification, validation and expansion. Chapter four delve into the analysis of the representations generated by the models defined in chapter three, focusing on comparing their functional characteristics with those of attributed incentive salience. Chapter five shows a potential application of the work presented so far in the context of automated engagement prediction and qualification in large scale scenarios. The thesis closes with a summary of the findings illustrated in each chapter, their limitation as well as recommendations and venues for future research.
