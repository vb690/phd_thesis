\section{Motivation}
\label{motivation}

The construct of motivation is a key concept for understanding why individuals seek out specific objects or experiences at particular times and why they react in particular ways when encountering stimuli considered of particular relevance [1]. In this view motivation can be defined as the process leading the modulation and reiteration of goal directed behaviours that once reached exerts rewarding (i.e. pleasurable) effects on the individual [2]. What is a common confound when defining this phenomenon is to partition it in different sub-components each one supposedly representing a different version of the motivational process (e.g. the motivation of X, the X motivation) [3]. The motivational process remains always the same, what changes is the nature of the goal producing the motivated behaviour [2]. If we represent motivation as a vector, its length would be the intensity of pursuit (or the amount of goal directed behaviour) while the angle the focus on a specific goal [2]. Summarizing we can say that the behaviour of an individual is motivated by the expectancy of pleasurable outcomes derived by the goal the behaviour is aiming to reach [1]. The aforementioned statement becomes particularly relevant for those spontaneous activities which are not driven by the fulfilment of fundamental needs (e.g. hunger or thirst) or by the avoidance of negative consequences (e.g. cognitive or physical pain), indeed for these activities what matters is the nature of the goal which may largely vary among individuals. Having a clear definition of the motivational process in place will help us understanding how some of the findings regarding motivational factors in videogames can be reframed in a behavioural context.

\section{An Historical View on Reward-driven Motivation}
\label{motivation_hist}
One of the early theorizations of human motivation proposed that individuals were motivated by the expectance of incentive outcomes. These expectations are formed through a process in which an individual learn the existence of an association between the actions he performs and the potential pleasurable outcomes associated to them [1]. Extending on this conceptualization, it has been proposed that the learning process does not only provide a way for forming the expectation of a pleasurable outcome in response to a specific behaviour but also allow to perceive the behaviour itself as source of hedonic reward [1], this concept of hedonic reward will be clarified later in this section as it constitutes an interesting point of connection with existing models of motivational factors in videogames. A third theoretical formulation, which fuses the two aforementioned approaches, making use of  concept related to learning through reinforcement formulated that a stimulus and the behaviours associated to it become relevant and salient for an individual as a consequence of learning its rewarding properties [1]. What written in this paragraph seems very distant from our initial starting point, to a certain extent an over-simplistic lab rat view on human behaviour, but what has been described here is one of the fundamental and most elegant (in terms of complexity to explanatory power ratio) mechanism able to explain and describe at why people do what they do, why they keep doing it and why they do that for a specific amount of time. Obviously taking this as the ultimate explanatory approach would be not just naïve but wrong as many layers of complexity need to be applied for approaching a good description of the motivational process in humans, however we can see some similarities with our previous overview on engagement: the relationships between the individual and the activity preformed, the ability of the activity in providing pleasurable experience and the necessity of feedback (i.e. reward) for maintaining engagement.

\subsection{Reward and Incentive Salience Attribution}
\label{incentive_salience}
Until now we have mainly used the terms reinforces and incentives for identifying stimuli able to drive and shape behaviour, but when it comes to define effective reinforces, is not just a matter of merely pairing a behaviour with a stimulus but the stimulus itself has to have particular properties. In this view, stimuli able to generate pleasurable feelings in the individual are the best candidates for being effective reinforces,  they are said having ‘rewarding properties’.  But what is, and how can be defined the reward?  The reward is a process generated in response to a stimulus making it desirable for its capacity to generate pleasurable responses. In this view, for being able to generate rewarding response, a stimulus needs two fundamental properties: it has to be wanted (i.e. it acquires the capacity to become desirable) and liked (i.e. it has to be able to generate pleasure in the individual) [37]. But how a particular object acquires this properties? Here comes in action the aforementioned learning processes: the repeated pairing between a stimulus and the reaction it generates in the individual imbue the first with rewarding properties. Moreover, through the aforementioned learning process (i.e. operant conditioning) not just the stimulus itself but also the connected instrumental behaviour will likely acquire the same rewarding properties [37]. A useful distinction that can be me here is between stimuli having primary and secondary reward properties:
Primary rewards 
These are type of stimuli having intrinsic rewarding properties due to their linkage with essential evolutionary needs (i.e. satisfaction of homeostatic needs),  the rewarding properties don’t have to be learned but already present, up to a certain extent, in the stimulus itself [45]. 
Secondary rewards
these are type of stimuli which don’t hold an innate capacity to generate rewarding experiences, their capacity to generate pleasurable experiences and consequently being wanted is strongly related to the occurrence of some of the aforementioned learning processes [45].

Despite this distinction might seems superfluous at a first glance, it has a particular relevance for understating the framework in which videogames lies. No element in a videogame context possesses intrinsic rewarding properties, here the learning process is essential for allowing the element to acquire the aforementioned rewarding properties. The attractive property of an in-game element is not present before the user start playing the game but it might be learned through the user – game interactions occurring during the playing activity.

\paragraph{Learning}
\label{learning}
Classical conditioning describes a learning process in which, independently from the activity of an individual, the repeated pairing of two stimuli will cause one to acquire the eliciting properties of the other [36]. Employing the aforementioned concepts of reinforce, the repeated pairing of a neutral object with reinforcing consequences will imbue the first with reinforcement properties. This concept is extremely simplistic and not suitable for describing human behaviour, however succinctly illustrate a very basic and common learning process other than being the ground from which operant conditioning stems.

Operant conditioning extends on the concept of classical condition introducing the agency of the individual. The concept refers to the process in which the frequency of a behaviour tends to increase when precise consequences are associated to it [35]. In this view, an operant is formalized as a goal directed behaviour while all the elements reinforcing the re-iteration of this behaviour are called reinforces [35]. The learning process here results from the relationship between a behaviour and its consequences, therefore the probability of behaviour to take place is related to its capability to produce reinforcement [34]. Again, reframing this concept in a videogame context the goal directed behaviour would be the interaction with the game environment while the reinforces are the consequences generate by the interaction itself, which might come in form of internal state only (i.e. pleasurable experiences) or also in the form of in game rewards (i.e. game feedbacks).

We will now illustrate the concepts of classical and operant conditioning, basic learning processes which are fundamental for introducing the higher level concept of incentive salience later on. For understanding the processes of classical and operant conditioning it is worth defining what a reinforcing object and process are. We can describe as reinforces those object having the capability to alter the probability of appearance of a specific behaviour [34, 35, 36].  On the other hand the reinforcing process identify the development of a condition in which a specific behaviour becomes more probable when followed by particular reinforcing events and becomes less probable when this last ones are not present anymore [34]. Reframing this concepts in a videogame context we can hypothesize that in-game contents or mechanics act as reinforcing objects when they produce positive outcomes for the player, in a cyclic process in which interacting with the game might produce positive reactions player-activity interactions which in response will make new interactions with the game more probable. 
We will now see the how classical and operant conditioning operationalize the aforementioned concepts of reinforcing object and process.

\section{Motivation and Engagement}
Motivation and engagement seems to be interchangeable terms but we argue that they are qualitatively different. Motivation pertain the state of an individual with resect to achieving a particular goal, perfroming a particular action or interacting with a particular object. Engagement on the other hand describes the quantity and quality of the interaction both from a behavioural and experiential point of view. From now on the relationship between motivation and engagement will be assumed we will have to rember that engagement, from a behavioural point of view, is a derivative product of the motivational state in which an individual is.
