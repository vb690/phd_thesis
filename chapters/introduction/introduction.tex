\section{General Introduction}
Human beings are capable of incredible feats, when we see an athlete competing at the Olympic games we might find ourself thinking "how much work they must have done to reach that level of performance". Similarly we might be surprised of the amount of effort miners during the 19th century gold rush were putting in finding even small ammount of gold nuggets. For having something more close to our everyday life, we might widen our eyes looking at the ammount of hours sank last week watching the latest Netflix series of playing the newly released videogames. But what do all these activities have in common? They are all fairly different from each but nevertheless seem to be able to generate prolonged and vigorous behavioural responses. From psychological point of view, we could say that in all those instances a common set of processes are at play which would conventionally go under the umbrella of "Motivation".


\section{Thesis Outline}
The goal of this thesis is to design, develop and test a methodology for approximating the motivational states of individuals in situations where large volumes of observational data are present but it is not possible to have direct contact with the individuals that generated them. Chapter one with a general outline on motivation and reward-driven motivation in particular. Stemming from here it highlights, how from a behavioural point of view, engagement can be seen as a derivative of the motivational state in which an individual is. Next, It continues showing how motivation can be conventionally assessed highlighting strengths and weaknesses of different approaches with particular attention to applications in large scale scenarios. The chapter closes on a review of works for estimating motivation and engagement at large scale with a particular focus on applications in a video game context. Chapter two aims to illustrate how we can leverage knowledge from theories of motivation for designing data driven solution for the estimation of the motivational state of individuals and engagement prediction. It opens with the illustration of a computational model of incentive salience, a particular theoretical account of reward-driven motivation, and it continues showing how the principles of this model can be used for defining the architecture of an artificial neural network. The chapter closes with a series of experiments aiming to assses the profiiency of the derived model through model comparison. Chapter three aims to illustrate how it is possible to extract and inspect the representantion generated by an articial neural network. It opens illustrating the concept of representation learning in the context of artificial neural network and it proceeds illustrating a series of methodologies for analyzing this representations and deriving insights from it. Chapter four illustartes how the model designed in chapter 2 can be extended and improved. Chapter 5 shows a potential application of the work carried out in this thesis for large scale engagement estimation in a videogame context.
