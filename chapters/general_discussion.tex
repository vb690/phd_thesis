\section{Contributions}

We will now proceed at summarizing the contribution of each chapter in the thesis along with a reflection on its limitations and the potential future research directions that could be taken in order to mitigate them.

\subsection{Chapter 1 - Connecting Motivation and Engagement}
\label{discussion_chapter_one}
In chapter \ref{chapter_lit_review} we focused on providing an overview of the psychological process of motivation highlighting its connection with the construct of engagement.

Relying on the framework proposed by Berridge et al. \cite{berridge1998role} we illustrated how motivation can be seen as process generating latent representations of objects informative of their capacity to produce rewarding experiences. We also illustrated how these representations act as modulatory mechanisms promoting or discouraging future interactions with said objects \cite{berridge2004motivation}.

Through a brief overview of the literature we showed how engagement with digital games can often be described in terms of the cognitive, emotional and behavioural manifestations resulting from the interactions that individuals have with particular game-object \cite{boyle2012engagement, jennett2008measuring, przybylski2010motivational}. These manifestations seem to arise from the interaction between the internal state of the individuals and the structural characteristics of the game \cite{lucas2004sex,o2008user,jennett2008measuring,boyle2012engagement,connolly2012systematic,csikszentmihalyi2014toward}. Moreover, the environment surrounding the individual appears to also have a role in this acting as a modulatory factor \cite{o2008user, bialas2014cultural, vihanga2019weekly, zendle2022transnational}.

Despite various attempts in the literature have been made for connecting these two processes \cite{przybylski2010motivational, nacke2011brainhex, deterding2022mastering}, a clear mechanistic description of this relationship was not always present. In this view, one major contribution of this chapter has been to outline a unifying theoretical framework for understanding the connection between neuroscientific theories of motivation and  two entities. We proposed to see motivation as a latent process arising from the interaction between individuals and (potentially rewarding) objects (i.e., videogames) and to consider engagement as its (noisy) manifestation in the observed behavioural space. 

Relying on this idea, we also highlighted the similarity between data-driven methodology for engagement prediction in a videogame context and latent variable models used in the behavioural neuroscience literature. In particular we showed that if we consider the functional goals a certain motivation-related processes (e.g., incentive salience attribution \cite{berridge2004motivation}) it is possible to understand engagement prediction models as supervise variations of certain latent variables models \cite{luxem2020identifying, mccullough2021unsupervised}.

\subsection{Chapter 2 - From Computational To Supervised Learning Models}
\label{discussion_chapter_two}
In chapter \ref{chapter_theory_modelling} we attempted to translate a computational model used for describing a specific type motivation-related latent process (i.e. attributed incentive salience) into a methodology for approximating such process within a supervised learning context.

The major contribution of this chapter has been to lay out a theoretical framework justifying the use of ANN for generating latent representations that would approximate the construct of attributed incentive salience. In particular, based on existing computational models \cite{mcclure2003computational, zhang2009neural} we illustrated why ANN, and their recurrent variant in particular, would be best suited for the task. We also proposed a series of architectural constrained designed  to encourage an ANN to generate latent representations compliant with the functional characteristics of attributed incentive salience. These were

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The use of a global model architecture for obtaining a single representation able to encompass multiple objects.
    \item The use of multi-task learning in order to force such representation to be a good descriptor of observed behaviour.
    \item The use of GAM-like mechanisms in order to include covariates of interest in the model while maintaining separability and interpretability of the inferred representations.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Chapter 3 - Designing, Implementing and Testing the Models }
\label{discussion_chapter_three}
In chapter \ref{chapter_implementation_testing} we proceeded at designing, implementing and testing the ANN architecture presented in chapter \ref{chapter_theory_modelling}.

The contribution of this chapter has been to validate some of the assumptions that were proposed in chapter \ref{chapter_theory_modelling}. We were able to confirm the important role of recurrency and non linearity in generating latent representations with good predictive power. 

\subsection{Chapter 4 - Validating the Properties of the Representations}
\label{discussion_chapter_four}
In comparison to other works focusing on the identification of latent states (or their manifold representation) from behavioural data \cite{calhoun2019unsupervised, luxem2020identifying, pereira2020quantifying, shi2021learning, mccullough2021unsupervised}, the present methodology offers a series of advantages. It does not require the Markov assumption, it generates continuous rather than discrete state space (hence the number of hidden states doesn't need to be specified) and it relies on a more easily scalable class of algorithms. Moreover, in contrast with a general tendency of utilising completely unsupervised techniques for capturing the manifold structure underlying behavioural data \cite{calhoun2019unsupervised, luxem2020identifying, pereira2020quantifying, shi2021learning, mccullough2021unsupervised}, our methodology attempts to extract representations which obey to specific functional constrains (see section \ref{manifold_learning}) and can therefore be more easily interpreted within a specific theoretical framework.

\subsection{Chapter 5 - Illustrating Industrial Applications of the Models}
\label{discussion_chapter_five}

Multi context engegemnt prediction
Multi objective engagement prediction
Dynamic engagement prediction
providing unifying framework for prediction and profiling within the same model.
It generates a representation that can be analyzed (similarly to what has been done in section \ref{representation_analysis}) or provided as input to other algorithms. Indeed, the encoder mentioned in section \ref{representation_analysis} can be thought of as an automatic feature extractor. This can be used to reduce complex time series data of varying length to fixed-size vectors able to describe the propensity of an individual to interact with an object. For example, the analysis presented in section \ref{partition_analysis} showed how this process could be applied for time-series partitioning of large dataset.

The present work leveraged data coming from video games but the adopted approach could easily be applied to other contexts. They only key requirement is the access to behavioural quantifiers describing the amount and intensity of interactions that an individual has with a particular object, service or task. This means that natural areas of application for our approach are those relying on the remote acquisition of behavioural data (e.g. web services or online experiments) but also situations in which large volumes of experimental data are available (e.g. large multi-center studies). 

\section{Conclusion}
In the present work we outlined a methodology for approximating motivation-related latent states in situations where large volumes of behavioural data are available but not direct contact with the individuals that generated them is possible. While doing so we tried to respect computational and theoretical constrains provided by previous works in the field of behavioural and affective neuroscience. 

Indeed we showed that it possible to embed theory-driven knowledge in data-driven approaches, allowing to more easily interpret and test hypotheses on the representation they produce. In comparison to other works focusing on the identification of latent states (or their manifold representation) from behavioural data \citep{calhoun2019unsupervised, luxem2020identifying, pereira2020quantifying, shi2021learning, mccullough2021unsupervised}, our methodology offered a series of advantages. It did not require the Markov assumption, it generated continuous rather than discrete state space and it relied on a more easily scalable class of algorithms. 

Moreover, in contrast with a general tendency of utilising completely unsupervised techniques for capturing the manifold structure underlying behavioural data \citep{calhoun2019unsupervised, luxem2020identifying, pereira2020quantifying, shi2021learning, mccullough2021unsupervised}, our methodology attempted to extract representations which obeyed to specific functional constrains therefore resulted to be more easily interpreted within a specific theoretical framework. In this view, despite our work never aimed at modelling specific cognitive or brain functions, we showed how it is possible to leverage computation model of such functions for designing data-driven methodologies for their inference. This appeared to be important in two fundamental ways. First, it allowed to construct data-driven solutions in a more principled way, rooting their functional form in the nature of the problem they were trying to solve. Second, it made it easier to a-priori specify theory-informed hypotheses and compare them against the behaviour of an otherwise black-box approach.

By connecting this methodology to the construct of engagement we showed how it could be leveraged within an industrial setting as a component of a system designed to perfrom cross-games automated engagement prediction and quantification.

\section{Limitations and Future Directions}
\label{discussion_limitations}
The work we just presented is not exempt from limitations. 

The 

Despite our findings seem to suggest a similarity between the functional characteristics of the representation inferred by our approach and the construct of attributed incentive salience these are the result of mostly qualitative, descriptive or exploratory analyses. 
Since our approach is attempting to solve an inverse problem, the issue of uniqueness arises. Many different latent states might have produced the behavioural patterns that our model observed and there is no guarantee of a strict one-to-one mapping between the representation generated by our model and attributed incentive salience.  More effort should be posed in future research for obtaining a clear formulation of the computations carried out by our architectures. Alternatively, an extensive work of validation could be carried out by comparing the representations generated by our architectures with those generated from data gathered through laboratory or simulation experiments. 

The behavioural profiles individuated in section \ref{partition_analysese} by our partition analyses generally reflect those predicted by theories of reward-driven motivation \citep{thorndike1927law,skinner1965science,berridge2004motivation} but they also show some unexpected and potentially contradictory results. Given the observational setting of our work and the unsupervised approach we adopted, the explanations provided in section \ref{partition_analysese} should be taken with caution and be seen as a method for generating testable hypotheses that should constitute the starting point for future investigations. Indeed, clarifying the the nature of some of the observed discrepancies may require experimental work in more controlled settings. Lastly, despite our approach appeared to deal gracefully with objects having different structural characteristics, these were limited to the domain of video games. In order to verify the generalizability of our approach, future work should include data generated from a variety of contexts (e.g. web services, online and laboratory-based experiments).
