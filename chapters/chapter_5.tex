\section{Introduction}
\label{industry_needs}
As we mentioned in chapter \ref{chapter_general_intro}, the aim of this thesis was twofold: deriving a methodology for inferring the motivational state of individuals while interacting with potentially rewarding object and presenting how this could be used in industry settings for automated engagement prediction.

In this chapter we will focus on sketching a system design for employing our methodology in an industry setting. First we will provide an overview of which potential need an industry player (or a collection of) might have with respect to engagement prediction. We will then proceed at illustrating a system designed for serving this needs. Finally we will present how the components of this system connect with the work we presented so far and how can be leveraged for satisfying said needs.
