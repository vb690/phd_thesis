\section{Introduction}
\label{industry_needs}
As we mentioned in chapter \ref{chapter_general_intro}, the aim of this thesis was twofold: deriving a methodology for inferring the motivational state of individuals while interacting with potentially rewarding object and presenting how this could be used in industry settings for automated engagement prediction.

In this chapter we will focus on sketching the design of a system for employing our methodology in an industry setting. First we will provide an overview of which potential need an industry player (or a collection of) might have with respect to engagement prediction. We will then proceed at illustrating a system designed for serving this needs. Finally we will present how the components of this system connect with the work we presented so far and how can be leveraged for satisfying said needs.

\section{The Needs from the Videogames Industry}
\label{industry_needs}
As we mentioned before despite the industry might be interested in the development of research projects the the focus of this project is less on the advancement of the research field on more focused on the solution of practical problems. 

In this view how does engagement connects with practical problems that the industry has? Very often (if not always) the success of a videogame title is strictly connected with either its ability to retain users or with the experience that users had with the product. The first is pivotal in scenarios where game is treated as a service sold to an audience (similarly to the function of streaming services) while the second is more relevant in scenarios where games are considered digital goods. 

In this context, engagement can be viewed as a measure of how a particular game was, is or will be able to retain users: if an individual is engaged with a particular service it is likely that will keep take advantage of it similarly if an individual had a particular good experience and gladly engaged with a particular digital good it is is more likely that will either suggest it to other users, buy similar products or buy product from the same seller.
