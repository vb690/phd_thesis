\caption[Partitions of the representations generated by the RNN architecture and its improved version from the behavioural metrics]{The two panels show the individuated partitions and associated profiles generated by applying Mini Batch KMeans to the representation generated by the RNN architecture and its improved version. All representations have been generated from the behavioural input.}
