\caption[\textbf{Lower dimensional representation of the latent representations generated by the RNN architecture}]{Each panel show a two-dimensional projection of the multi-dimensional representation inferred by the RNN architecture. Rows from A to D report the representation inferred at $t1$, $t2$, $t3$ and $t4$. Colours in the large panel indicate which game object the representation is coming from while those in the small panels indicate the discounted sum of future predictions for a single target.}
